        <h4><strong>Live Ramadan Lectures</strong></h4>
        <p>We help to locate ramadan lecture for the Muslims brothers and sister to keep the spirit of Ramadan intact and for them to put there minds faitful to the almight Allah and benefits from the mount of Ramadan “Our presence on the internet is very weak, which is a shame for a Nation that is supposed to be the best nation ever sent out to mankind. I am addressing here those people who have a real concern for spreading Islam, and not just anyone . . .   we acknowledge that Islam must become the international religion which all people should adopt and know about to every one who is none muslim and a muslim, we must convey it to mankind using all available means and methods and make life easy to understand how easy islam is and its a religioun of pease and love to one and other.</p><br>
        <p>This really could be our last Ramadan, how would we want our last Ramadan to be, Imagine running out of good deeds and falling off the Sirat (in the Hereafter)  Work to free self from Hell Fire  Work to purify self from sins.
        Ramadan is a pillar, treat it with the same excitement as we would with something like embarking on another pillar of Islam like Hajj
        Work on sincerity
        During Ramadan, if an argument arises say “I am fasting”
        Ramadan shows preference of akhirah over worldly desires, strive to do the same in our lives
        Do not curse, insult, mock, raise voice, be obscene</p><br>
        <h4><strong>Free Food ( free Iftor) Location</strong></h4>
        <p>In Islam, Ramadan is a holy month of fasting, introspection and prayer. Fasting is one of the five fundamental principles of Islam. Each day during Ramadan, followers of Islam, known as Muslims, do not eat or drink from sunrise to sunset. This charity food or free food, is called Nazri. In fact, Nigerians donate food and call it Nazr. The main food or Nazri in Ramadan is “Ash”, a traditional to all Muslims and Allah reward anyone who do good and give out to the people aboundantly.</p><br>
        <h4><strong>We Help You Pay Your Zakat</strong></h4>
        <p>Zakah (almsgiving) is the required charity of a Muslim. It is one of the five pillars of Islam. It is given by free Muslims (not slaves), who have a certain amount of wealth.  (And [in the daytime and at night] establish the prayer and pay Zakah and [for the cause of your religion and state] lend to Allah a befitting loan, and remember whatever good you send forth for yourselves you shall find it with Allah better than before and greater in reward.) [Qur’an 73:20]

        There are also many warnings against those who do not spend for the sake of Allah:
        (And spend something (in charity) out of the substance which We have bestowed on you, before Death should come to any of you and he should say, “O my Lord! Why didst Thou not give me respite for a little while? I should then have given (largely) in charity, and I should have been one of the doers of good.” But to no soul will Allah grant respite when the time appointed (for it) has come; and Allah is well-acquainted with (all) that ye do.) [Qur’an 63:11]
        </p><br>
        <h4><strong>Hajj & Umrah</strong></h4>
        <p>Hajj is one of most important pillars of Islam and it is one of greatest religious duties.  It is on people for the sake of Allah to perform Hajj of his house, anyone who is able to undertake the journey to him. (2:196)
        It has been mentioned in another Hadith: “Anyone who renounces his obligatory Hajj without any excuse will be re awoken as Jew or Christian”
        We read in a Hadith from Imam Sadiq (a.s.): “Persons who perform Hajj and Umrah are guests of Allah. He will grant them their wishes and any prayer that they recite will be accepted. And if they pray for intercession about a person it will be accepted … and if they die in this way Allah will forgive all of their sins”
